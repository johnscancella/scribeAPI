The Library of Congress is expanding its crowdsourcing capability with the launch of the Column Sleuth application in Fall 2017. In a partnership between the National Digital Initiatives (NDI), Serial and Government Publications Division, and the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO), the application showcases hidden collections and helps Americans add to the data set of text useful for researchers who use visualization, text analysis, and other digital humanities methodologies to discover new knowledge. 

The Library of Congress has invested a large amount of resources into building digitized collections, but some items with hand-written text, images, and collection-level-only descriptions hinder robust search on loc.gov. The Libraryâ€™s first attempt recruiting members of the public to increase findability on our website began in 2008 when the Photography and Prints Division published a collection of photographs on the [Flickr Commons](https://www.loc.gov/rr/print/flickr_pilot.html). Visitors were asked to help identify people and places in the photographs, and once verified, this rich information was used to enhance the online catalog and improve access for all users. 

In this latest effort, the Column Sleuth application will invite people to identify columns of text, images, and illistrations in our historic newspaper collections. The application will also generate public domain image galleries for scholarship and creative play. The newspaper pages that are marked in Column Sleuth are selected from [Chronicling America](http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov): a website providing access to digitized historic newspapers, contributed by institutions all over the U.S. Chronicling America is produced by the National Digital Newspaper Program, a partnership between the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Library of Congress.

Many in the library community have paved the way for Column Sleuth. The application was built with <a href="http://scribeproject.github.io">Scribe <i class="fa fa-external-link icon-external-link"><span>External</span></i></a>, an open-source codebase created and used by New York Public Library. Updates will be made available online for anyone who might want to use it for their own collections as we further develop the platform. Cultural heritage institutions with established transcription programs such as NARA and the Smithsonian have perfected workflows and user engagement strategies that the platform will leverage and build upon.
