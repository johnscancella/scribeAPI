#### What is Column Sleuth? 
It is a website where you can help identify columns of text, photographs, and illustrations published in historic newspapers: You will create information and identify images in ways that can be used by everyone: the public, researchers, artists and more.

#### I’m in the middle of a task, but I need help. What do I do?
You can find a tutorial for each step on the right hand side of the screen. Look for “View a Tutorial” for task-specific instructions. Have suggestions to improve the instructions? Send them to [ndi@loc.gov](mailto:ndi@loc.gov) or tweet @LC_labs. 

#### What should  I do if the mark around the column is wrong?
Sometimes while marking, you will encounter a page that has already been marked. More rarely, you may see a mark that doesn't capture the entire column. To fix a bad mark, you can click the mark. A small encircled red x will appear to the upper right corner side of the mark. Click the encircled red x and the Mark will be deleted. You can then redo the mark. You can also select the DONE button and allow volunteers in the transcribe step catch the error.

#### How can I zoom in or move around on the page? 
You will often need to zoom in or pan across the newspaper page to read the text. Use the zoom and pan tool on the left side of the screen. You can also use shortcut keys – learn more in the on-page tutorial (find it in the right hand side of the screen). 

#### I want to read the original newspaper page (and maybe some of the pages that came after). Can I do that? 
Yes! You can view and read the newspaper in Chroncling America. Select “View the original page” and a separate tab will open for you to explore.

#### Can I share the page I’m working on with my friends?
Yes, please do! You find the social share buttons for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ in the right hand column under the tutorial buttons. 

#### How can I explore the data?
Browse the public domain Column Sleuth Gallery to see what you and other participants have selected. You can also download and use the data sets from Column Sleuth data, shared as JSON. We hope that educators, researchers, and artists will take advantage of the ability to better explore and create with our collections.
