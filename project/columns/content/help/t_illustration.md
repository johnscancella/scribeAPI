# Describe the Picture

Most pictures have captions or descriptions. Enter the text exactly as you see it. Include capitalization and punctuation, but remove hyphenation that breaks words at the end of the line. Use new lines to separate different parts of captions and descriptions. 

You can zoom in for better looks at the page. You can also select “View the original page” in the upper right corner of the screen to view the original high resolution image of the newspaper.
