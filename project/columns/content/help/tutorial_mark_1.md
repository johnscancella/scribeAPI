# Mark

In the Mark step, your task is to identify columns in the newspaper pages. For our project, “columns” means text, illustrations, photographs, comics, and cartoons that are lined up vertically. You'll use the marking tool to draw a box around the picture using your mouse. 

After you have marked all columns on the newspaper page, click the DONE button. Skip the page altogether by clicking the Skip this page button.

Not sure if a column should be marked? Select the “Done for now, more left to mark” button so another volunteer can help finish that page.
