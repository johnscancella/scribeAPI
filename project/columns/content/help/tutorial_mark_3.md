# Existing Marks

Occasionally, you may see existing marks on the page. If the marks are correct and nothing is left to mark, click the DONE button. 

What happens if someone has left a bad mark? You can remove the mark by clicking on it and selecting the red encircled x in the upper right corner. Pages with bad marks can also be weeded out in the Transcribe task. 

You can hide someone elseâ€™s marks on the page using the mark toggle on the left side of the screen.
