#Transcribe

In the Transcribe task, you’ll transcribe the text exactly as you see it. Please transcribe titles, captions, and cutlines of the pictures. If the text is hard to read, do your best and keep going.  

Some captions may be pre-populated by text from Chronicling America. You can edit the text or choose to delete and transcribe it.

Click the “Need Help?” button to get additional information about each field. 

If the marked area contains no picture or only a partial picture, click the “Bad Region?” button and then “Save.”
